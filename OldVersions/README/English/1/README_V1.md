# Seanpm2001's GitHub Backup Tool

This is a WIP custom backup script for my GitHub account. Sure, a normal account takeout is fine, but it really doesn't suit my needs, because:

1. I can't download everything in 7 days
2. I have to upkeep data, so the download amount would be ridiculously high as it exponentiates
3. It is completely ridiculous to clone terabytes of data nonstop endlessly for each individual change. Not only would it waste space and bandwidth, but it would be completely unnecessary.

Currently, my goals are to:

- [ ] Build a functional backup script
- [ ] Request a copy of all GitHub repositories
- [ ] Setup all requested copies as mirrors
- [ ] Consistently fetch upstream for new commits from GitHub to the Git server
- [ ] Keep the server secure
- [ ] Backup the server
- [ ] Consistently use and backup
- [ ] Maybe backup to BitBucket, GitLab, and SourceForge someday.

Additional goals to upkeep are:

- [ ] Keep the program secure
- [ ] Keep the program stable
- [ ] Phone home as little as possible
- [ ] Do not rely on Google source code
- [ ] Do not make another dependancy
- [ ] Keep a low memory footprint

The project is currently written only in Shell, but I will expand to other languages.

I am still researching the REST API, this project is a major work in progress.
