# About:
# I have chosen Shell as the main project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Seanpm2001_GitHub_Backup_Tool) because Shell is the go-to language for debug scripting on UNIX, and is native to several parts of functionality on this project. I am making it a project language, as Shell is just beginning to be used on this project, and it needed a project language file to represent it.
